# newportfoliowebsite

I redid my portfolio website because I felt there were a lot of things that could be changed. It is made in HTML,CSS,Javascript, and Bootstrap. 


Edit: I never actually gave credit to the awesome people who made the template. https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-freelancer

Seriously, it's easy to make your own website and plus, if you want to edit it to your own desire, it's not hard. I apologize for not giving credit sooner.
